# Note! You don't have to override repos.txt but we've added this one as an example
# for those cases where you want to override the default one that is inside the vertx-platform.jar
# e.g. perhaps you have your own Maven repository you want to use

# Local Maven repo on filesystem
mavenLocal:~/.m2/repository

# Maven central
maven:http://repo2.maven.org/maven2

# Sonatype snapshots
maven:http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots

# Bintray
bintray:http://dl.bintray.com
